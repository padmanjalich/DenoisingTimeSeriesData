# Time Series Denoising with Autoencoder

## Project Description

This project involves the development of an autoencoder model specifically designed to denoise complex time series data. The architecture balances complexity with interpretability, effectively capturing and reconstructing the essential temporal patterns in the data.

## Model Architecture

- **Input Layer:**
  - The starting point for receiving raw time series data.

- **Encoding Layers:**
  - Consist of two dense layers with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation.
  - Transform input data into a condensed representation.
  - Capture salient temporal patterns in the time series.

- **Decoding Layers:**
  - Use dense layers with sigmoid activation to reconstruct the original data.
  - Aim to preserve the structural integrity of the time series.
  - Mitigate information loss during reconstruction.

## Key Features

- **Bottleneck Effect:**
  - The architecture creates a bottleneck, forcing the model to learn a compact representation.
  - Enhances denoising capabilities by focusing on essential features.

- **Denoising Capability:**
  - Effectively reduces noise while retaining important data patterns.
  - Provides a robust framework for handling intricate time series data.
